# TimerToDo

## [Check out a video demo here](https://youtu.be/OVsIRyGBInU)

A to-do list that uses JDBC to connect to a MySQL server and store data entered by users. Eventually, this could serve as a small company's invoice system or something along those lines, given this project's continued development. Keeping track of who does what job, the cost, and their deadlines is made easy. 

## If you want to use this project you should know :

---

This project relies on a MySQL database called "todolist" with a table called "list_items". As this software is obviously not consumer ready in its current state, to use this software, you must make a MySQL database and table named accordingly. The following is an example of a creation script that would work:

```
create table list_items
(
	time_due datetime, 
	time_started timestamp default current_timestamp on update current_timestamp, 
	person varchar(255), 
	task varchar(20), 
	task_description varchar(255),
	completed boolean default false, 
	task_id int auto_increment,
	primary key (task_id)
);
```
