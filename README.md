# TimerToDo
A to-do list that uses JDBC to connect to a MySQL server and store data entered by users. It this gets fleshed out more, it could be the basis for a small companies invoice system or something along those lines. Keeping track of who does what job, the cost, and their deadlines is made easy. 

tl:dr - This is a to-do list that multiple people can use at the same time.
